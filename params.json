{"body":"ANDROID-BSF-API\r\n===============\r\n\r\nAndroid-bsf-api is a port/fork of the Apache Commons Bean Scripting Framework\r\nAPI for the Android platform. It includes the `javax.script.*` classes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bsf-api port, android-bsf-api also includes a modified\r\nimplementation of the `sun.misc.Service` and the `javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry`\r\nclasses. These implementations look for service provider declarations in the\r\n`ANDROID-META-INF/services/` folder rather than the `META-INF/services` folder, \r\nwhich is normally stripped away by the Android `dex` packager.\r\n\r\nMore information about the original bsf-api can be found at the \r\n[official BSF site](http://commons.apache.org/bsf/).\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding in Your Project\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to include the library in your projects:\r\n\r\n1. You can download the released jar file in the [Downloads section](https://github.com/wuman/android-bsf-api/downloads).\r\n2. If you use Maven to build your project you can simply add a dependency to \r\n   the desired component of the library.\r\n\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.wu-man</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>android-bsf-api</artifactId>\r\n            <version>3.1.2</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking \r\nthe repository and sending a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n    or more contributor license agreements.
